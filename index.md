# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone

My first milestone is a hardware showcase demonstrating the fuctionality of the lock mechanism and the rasberry pie camera module. The lock is a simple 3D printed assembly put together with screws. A sliding bolt is controlled by a servo motor, forming a rack and pinion mechanism which converts the rotational motion of the servo motor to linear motion, allowing the bolt to slide in and out. To demonstrate, I programmed the arduino to open or close the lock when a push button is pressed, creating a toggle switch. The code for this was esepcially interesting to develop despite it not having a direct connection to my main project.

# Starter Project: Customizable Arduino project 
  
  For my starter project, I opted to work on the cuztomizable arduino. I chose this particular project as a precursor to my main project, which also uses an arduino board and curcuit building. For input and output, I picked a potentiometer and a servo motor, the other primary parts of my curcuit an arduino uno microcontroller, a protoboard, as well as jumper and solid core wires. A potentiometer is a variable resister which can take a constant input voltage and output a restance that varies as the user turns a knob. This varying output volatge is read by a built in function analogRead() which assigns an integer value from 0 and 1023 to the changing voltage. Another function in the code takes this 10 bit integer and scales it between 0 and 180 degrees, which are the rotation limits of the servo motor. Servos are special types of motors that take a pulse through a PWM connection on the arduino board and make precise movements to specific locations. As the potentiometer knob is rotated, the servo motor turns. 

  I didn't face all to many challenges when working on the core project, only a little difficulty when soldering connections onto the protoboard. Motivated by my success, I decided to modify my project by adding a 7 segment display to further scale the potentiometer readings between 1 and 5 to display a crude percentage of how much the servo had rotated. A 7 segemnt display is an eletrical component with 7 LEDs arranged in a rectangular pattern. As these LEDs are lit up in sequence, different numerals and characters are displayed. Although I was able to complete a working ciruit and program a cycle of numbers to be displayed, I was unable to interface the display with the project itself as the programming is something I have to work out over the next few weeks.
